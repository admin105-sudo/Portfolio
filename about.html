<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a passionate and motivated Cloud and DevOps Engineer with a strong foundation in cloud computing, automation, and modern DevOps practices. I have a keen interest in designing scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and continuously improving application delivery through automation and CI/CD pipelines. With a background in Computer Applications and hands-on project experience, I enjoy transforming ideas into working cloud solutions that follow industry best practices.

My technical journey began with learning the fundamentals of Linux, networking, and version control using Git and GitHub. Over time, I developed a deep interest in cloud infrastructure and DevOps workflows, which led me to explore AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch. I have practical experience in deploying and managing cloud resources, ensuring security through proper IAM configurations, and monitoring system performance using AWS CloudWatch.

One of my key strengths is Infrastructure as Code (IaC). I have worked extensively with Terraform to automate the provisioning of AWS infrastructure, including VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and IAM roles. By creating reusable Terraform modules, I was able to reduce manual setup time and improve consistency across environments. This experience helped me understand the importance of automation, version control, and repeatability in modern cloud environments.

In addition to infrastructure automation, I have hands-on experience with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins. I have configured automated pipelines integrated with GitHub, Docker, and AWS EC2 to streamline the build, test, and deployment processes. These pipelines helped reduce deployment errors and improved delivery speed, reinforcing my understanding of DevOps culture and continuous improvement. I have also worked with Docker for containerization and have basic knowledge of Kubernetes concepts for container orchestration.

Monitoring and observability are areas I actively focus on. I have experience using AWS CloudWatch as well as open-source tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage. I have configured alerts and notifications using SNS to ensure real-time visibility into system health and performance.

I have also built serverless, event-driven applications using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and EventBridge. These projects helped me understand how to design highly scalable and cost-efficient architectures without managing servers, while still maintaining reliability and performance.

I am a continuous learner who enjoys staying updated with the latest cloud and DevOps trends. I value problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration, and I am always eager to learn new tools and technologies. My goal is to grow as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer by contributing to real-world projects, improving system reliability, and building efficient cloud solutions that create meaningful impact.</p>
